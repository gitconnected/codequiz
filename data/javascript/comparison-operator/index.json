  "explanation": "When comparing values of different types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers. '0' becomes 0, false becomes 0, true becomes 1, '' becomes 0, 'foo' becomes NaN (note: NaN is not equal to anything, including itself). If 2 strings are compared, it will use dictionnary order based on Unicode.",
